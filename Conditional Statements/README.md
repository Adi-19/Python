# Conditional Statements

# If Statement :
An if statement must always start with an if clause, which contains the first condition that is checked. If this evaluates to True, Python runs the code indented in this if block and then skips to the rest of the code after the if statement.

# elif: 
elif is short for "else if." An elif clause is used to check for an additional condition if the conditions in the previous clauses in the if statement evaluate to False.
